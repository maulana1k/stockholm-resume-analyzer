AI-Powered Candidate Evaluation Platform
Project Report by John Doe

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Developed a scalable backend system for AI-driven candidate evaluation that processes CVs and project reports to generate comprehensive assessment scores.

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

Microservices Architecture:
- Authentication Service: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
- Document Processing Service: Handles PDF/DOCX parsing and text extraction
- AI Evaluation Service: LLM integration with prompt chaining
- Vector Database Service: Qdrant integration for RAG context retrieval
- Queue Management Service: BullMQ for async job processing

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

1. Prompt Design & LLM Chaining:
- Implemented 4-step evaluation pipeline: CV extraction → job matching → project scoring → summary generation
- Created structured prompt templates with temperature control (0.1 for consistency)
- Added validation layer to ensure JSON response formatting

2. RAG System Implementation:
- Integrated Qdrant vector database for job description storage
- Implemented semantic search with cosine similarity
- Designed context injection strategy for relevant prompt enhancement
- Added hybrid search (semantic + keyword) for better retrieval

3. Error Handling & Resilience:
- Implemented exponential backoff for LLM API rate limits (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- Added circuit breaker pattern after 5 consecutive failures
- Created comprehensive logging with Winston logger
- Implemented retry mechanisms for file processing failures

4. Queue System with BullMQ:
- Designed job queue with priority levels
- Implemented worker processes with concurrency control
- Added job progress tracking and status updates
- Set up automatic retry with maximum attempt limits

CODE QUALITY FEATURES

- TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive unit tests with 85% coverage
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Environment-based configuration management

ERROR HANDLING STRATEGIES

LLM API Failures:
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached responses when available
- Circuit breaker to prevent cascade failures

File Processing:
- Multiple PDF/DOCX parsing libraries with fallbacks
- File size and type validation
- Graceful degradation for corrupted files

Database Operations:
- Connection pooling and timeout management
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Deadlock detection and resolution

DEPLOYMENT & MONITORING

- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
- Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- Health check endpoints with detailed status reporting

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

- Redis caching for frequent LLM prompts
- Database query optimization with indexes
- Connection pooling for database and Redis
- Gzip compression for API responses
- CDN integration for static assets

TESTING STRATEGY

- Unit tests for all service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for evaluation pipeline
- Load testing with Artillery.io
- Security testing with OWASP ZAP

CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

Challenge: LLM API rate limiting
Solution: Implemented smart queue with priority and backoff

Challenge: Large file processing memory issues
Solution: Stream-based processing with chunking

Challenge: Vector database search latency
Solution: Optimized embedding dimensions and indexing

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Multi-LLM provider support with automatic failover
- Advanced analytics dashboard for evaluation metrics
- Real-time collaboration features for hiring teams
- Mobile app with offline capability

CONCLUSION
The platform successfully demonstrates robust backend architecture patterns, effective AI integration, and production-ready error handling. The system handles scale while maintaining reliability and accuracy in candidate evaluations.
